    "<li><p><b>Class variable</b> − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Data member</b> − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Function overloading</b> − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Instance variable</b> − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Inheritance</b> − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Instance</b> −  An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Instantiation</b> − The creation of an instance of a class.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Method</b> − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><b>Object</b> − A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</p></li>\n",
